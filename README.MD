## Note for Windows Users

**Please be aware that some antivirus software on Windows might flag the Go binaries generated by `go build` as false positives due to the way Go compiles executables. This is a common occurrence and does not mean the binaries are harmful. You may need to whitelist the binaries in your antivirus software to prevent them from being flagged.**
